# Pokemon-Battle
Every pokemon participates in 1808 matches, with each winning point worth one point.

The program works with pokemon's base stats. As there are some variables that could be changed by chance in the pokemon go game, I have taken them as the same for all pokemons. In order to get the best results, all of these variables were created by trial and error. Here is list of these variables;

ATTACKER LEVEL = 30

ATTACK POWER = 100

TYPE BONUS = 1

Due to some pokemons hitting harder with special attacks, I used their special attack stats in the battle damage calculator. 


It takes almost 15 minutes to complete all steps. The duration of each step is shown below;

URL CREATOR = 10 SECONDS 

STATS PARSER = 8 MINUTES

POKEMON COMPARISON = 10 SECONDS

UPDATING DATAS IN EXCEL SHEET = 7 MINUTES
